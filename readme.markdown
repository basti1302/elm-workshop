Elm Workshop
============

Getting started
---------------

Clone this repository into a directory of your choice:

```
# via ssh
git clone git@github.com:basti1302/elm-workshop.git
# or via https
git clone `https://github.com/basti1302/elm-workshop.git`

cd elm-workshop
```

In the root directory of the repository, run
```
npm install
```

This will install (among other things) Elm 0.18 as a local dependency.

Next, run

```
npm start
```

This will start the Webpack dev server in watch mode. Always keep this running while you are working on the exercises.

Open the file `frontend/elm/Example001.elm` in an editor. Now you are ready to go.

Go to http://localhost:7000 to start the workshop. Have fun!
